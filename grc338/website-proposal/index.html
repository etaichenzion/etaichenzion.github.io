            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Woof Café</p>
            
            <p>Woof Café is an laid-back, easygoing, dog-themed café that offers wonderful pastries, coffees, and teas with wonderful outside seating. Did I forget to mention you will be cuddling with the cutest dogs in town?</p>
            

            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target audience for Woof Café is a younger millenial dog-lover. We want this place to be lively but not childish.</p>
           
            <p>We want Woof Café to be a place from people to come chat, study, de-stress, play, and relax all in the presence of fluffy puppies. We want our café to also serve as a way for dogs to get adopted and to find their forever home.</p>

Whether you are chatting with old friends or cramming for a test, the dogs are there to help you relax from the craziness of the world and get some much needed cuddle time. </p>

					<h1> Support </h1>
				
					<p>Dog adoption can be a very intimidating process for both you and the dog so we put it on ourselves to provide a calm enviroment for people to get to meet our wonderful pups. You might even find that special little boy or girl that you want to take home! Sadly there are so many dogs at our local shelter that don't get this amazing opportunity so we encourage you to check out the shetler near you and maybe you will find a new best friend. </p>
